# üè¢ Multi-Site Data Center & Physical Setup

## üó∫Ô∏è Site Locations
- **Primary Site (Site 1)**: Located in Region A (Main Business Operations)
- **Secondary Site (Site 2)**: Located in Region B (Disaster Recovery, Offsite Backup)
- **Tertiary Site (Optional - Site 3)**: Located in Region C (Backup or Secondary Disaster Recovery Site)

## ‚ö° Power & Rack Configuration
### **Power Setup**
- **Dual PDUs (Power Distribution Units)** for each site to ensure power redundancy.
- **UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)** installed at each site to provide backup during power outages:
  - **APC 2kVA UPS** for each data center.
  - **On-Site Backup Generators**: To ensure power during extended outages (only if required).
  
### **Rack Configuration**
- **42U Rack** in each site.
- **Top-Down Layout**:
  - **Site 1**: Switch > Router > Firewall > NAS > Server
  - **Site 2**: Switch > Router > Firewall > NAS > Server
  - **Site 3**: Optional for further backup capacity or load balancing.

## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Cooling & Environmental Monitoring
- **Environmental Control Systems** (AC + Humidity Control) in all sites.
- **Temperature Sensors** installed in each data center, integrated with centralized monitoring tools like **Zabbix**.
- **Cooling Failover**: Redundant AC units to ensure cooling in case of failure.
- **Environmental Alerts**: Zabbix or Grafana to trigger alerts for abnormal temperature or humidity levels.

## üîÑ Data Replication & Backup
### **Data Replication Strategy**
- **Synchronous Replication** for critical applications and databases between Site 1 and Site 2 (real-time replication).
  - **AWS S3 Cross-Region Replication** for storing critical files in both primary and secondary locations.
  - **Database Replication** (e.g., **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**) to ensure data is consistent across all sites.
  
### **Backup Strategy**
- **Primary Site (Site 1)**: Local backup solutions like **Veeam** and **Rsync**.
- **Secondary Site (Site 2)**: Offsite cloud backup using **AWS Backup** or **Azure Backup**.
- **Disaster Recovery Site** (Site 3, optional): A cold standby backup server that can take over in case Site 1 or Site 2 fails.
- **Backup Frequency**: Critical systems have an RPO (Recovery Point Objective) of 1 hour, with RTO (Recovery Time Objective) of 4 hours.
  
### **Offsite Backup & Cloud Storage**
- **Rsync** + **Rclone** for syncing data to cloud storage (e.g., **AWS S3** or **Azure Blob Storage**).
  
## üåê Network Redundancy
### **Networking Setup**
- **Multi-Site VLANs** configured to segment traffic across different sites securely.
- **SD-WAN** or **Cross-Site VPN** for secure communication between sites.
  - **VPN Failover**: In case one site loses connectivity, VPN traffic is automatically routed to the next available site.
  - **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** for dynamic routing and failover.

### **Load Balancing**
- Use **HAProxy** or **NGINX** for distributing traffic across sites (active-active or active-passive configurations).
- **Anycast IPs** for seamless DNS failover, directing users to the nearest data center.
  
### **Inter-Site Connectivity**
- **High-Speed Fiber Links** between the primary and secondary data centers for low-latency, high-bandwidth connectivity.
- **Backup Communication Links** (e.g., 4G/5G LTE for emergency access).

## üõ°Ô∏è Access Control & Security
### **Access Control Systems**
- **Centralized RFID Access System** at each site to control physical access to racks and server rooms.
- **CCTV** monitoring in each data center for security.
- **24/7 Security Personnel** for physical site monitoring.
  
### **Firewalls & Security**
- **FortiGate 200D** firewalls at each site for network perimeter security.
- **Intrusion Detection Systems** (IDS) to monitor malicious activities in all locations.
- **Cross-Site Security Monitoring**: Tools like **Splunk** or **Graylog** to collect and correlate security logs from all data centers.

### **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- **Azure AD MFA** for administrative and remote access to the infrastructure.
- **Google Authenticator** or **Microsoft Authenticator** used for staff and admin accounts.

## üîê Disaster Recovery & Failover
### **Disaster Recovery Site (Site 2)**
- **Cold Standby Site**: Proxmox or VMware node setup for quick activation in case of disaster at the primary site.
- **Failover Testing**: Regular failover drills between Site 1 and Site 2 to ensure RTO and RPO targets are met.

### **Continuous Data Availability**
- **Site Failover**: In case of a primary site failure, workloads automatically failover to the secondary site, ensuring no downtime.
- **Site Restoration**: Once the primary site is restored, data syncs automatically from the secondary site to maintain consistency.

## üåç Global Monitoring & Alerts
- **Centralized Monitoring** using **Zabbix**, **Grafana**, and **Prometheus**.
  - **Centralized Log Aggregation** using **Graylog** or **Splunk** to monitor logs across all sites.
  - **Real-Time Monitoring** of hardware health, network connectivity, and resource utilization in each data center.
  
## üíæ Backup & Storage
- **Storage Setup**: Redundant storage at each site using **NAS (Network Attached Storage)** and **SAN (Storage Area Network)** configurations.
- **Cloud Storage**: Backup data is replicated to cloud storage services like **AWS S3** or **Azure Blob Storage** to ensure offsite availability.

## üì¶ Server and Application Failover
- **VMware/Proxmox Clusters** for server failover between sites.
- **Database Replication** for high availability: e.g., **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL** replication.
- **File Syncing**: **Rsync** to sync files between primary and secondary sites.

### Example of Deployment & Configuration Flow

1. **Primary Site Deployment**:
   - Deploy servers, storage, and networking components.
   - Configure **VLANs**, **VPNs**, **SD-WAN**, and **firewalls**.
   - Set up **Backup Solutions** and **Data Replication**.

2. **Secondary Site Setup**:
   - Mirror configurations from the primary site.
   - Ensure data replication (AWS S3, RDS).
   - Test failover capabilities.

3. **Tertiary Site (Optional)**:
   - Similar setup as secondary site with minimal resources, ready for failover.
   - Sync backup data to this site for high availability.
