## üîå Network Segmentation

Each site uses VLANs to separate traffic and ensure security and performance. Here is a breakdown of the VLANs for each site:

| VLAN ID | Purpose              | Subnet                     | DHCP Range                | Site            |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|

| 20      | Staff Network         | `192.168.20.0/24`          | `192.168.20.100 ‚Äì 192.168.20.200` | India HQ        |
| 30      | Student Network       | `192.168.30.0/24`          | `192.168.30.100 ‚Äì 192.168.30.200` | India HQ        |
| 40      | Admin Network         | `192.168.40.0/24`          | `192.168.40.100 ‚Äì 192.168.40.200` | Dubai Branch    |
| 50      | Staff Network         | `192.168.50.0/24`          | `192.168.50.100 ‚Äì 192.168.50.200` | Dubai Branch    |
| 60      | Student Network       | `192.168.60.0/24`          | `192.168.60.100 ‚Äì 192.168.60.200` | Dubai Branch    |
| 70      | Admin Network         | `192.168.70.0/24`          | `192.168.70.100 ‚Äì 192.168.70.200` | India Branch    |
| 80      | Staff Network         | `192.168.80.0/24`          | `192.168.80.100 ‚Äì 192.168.80.200` | India Branch    |
| 90      | Student Network       | `192.168.90.0/24`          | `192.168.90.100 ‚Äì 192.168.90.200` | India Branch    |

### Notes:
- Each branch uses **MPLS** for high-performance connectivity and **Site-to-Site VPN** for redundancy and secure communication between sites.
- VLANs are configured for segregation of traffic and to improve security, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
- Each site has its own dedicated **DHCP range** to ensure proper IP allocation.
