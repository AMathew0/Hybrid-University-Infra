## üõ†Ô∏è Backup & Disaster Recovery

A comprehensive backup and disaster recovery plan is in place to ensure the integrity and availability of the university's data.

### Backup Solutions:
- **VM Snapshots**: Regular snapshots of VMs are taken to ensure minimal downtime during failures or maintenance. Snapshots are taken at the following intervals:
  - **Daily** for critical VMs.
  - **Weekly** for non-critical VMs.
- **Data Backups**: Critical data on NAS and SAN storage is backed up daily to AWS S3 to ensure off-site storage for disaster recovery. Backup frequency is as follows:
  - **Full Backup**: Once a month (all data).
  - **Incremental Backup**: Daily (changed data).
  - **Differential Backup**: Weekly (data changes since the last full backup).

### Disaster Recovery Plan:
- **Failover Sites**: The virtualization infrastructure is designed with high availability in mind, ensuring failover capabilities across sites.
- **Data Replication**: Critical data on the SAN and NAS systems is replicated between sites to provide redundancy in case of site failure.

## üåê Network Segmentation & VLAN Configuration

To ensure security, efficiency, and optimal network performance, Hybrid University utilizes network segmentation and VLANs. Below is an overview of the network segmentation and VLANs deployed across the sites:

### VLANs Configuration:
| **VLAN ID** | **VLAN Name**       | **Subnet**          | **Purpose**                               | **Devices**                     |
|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **10**      | **Management VLAN**  | `192.168.10.0/24`   | Network Management, Admin Access         | VM Hosts, Network Devices       |
| **20**      | **Application VLAN** | `192.168.20.0/24`   | Application Servers                      | Web, Database Servers           |
| **30**      | **Storage VLAN**     | `192.168.30.0/24`   | Shared Storage, Backup Servers           | NAS, SAN Storage                |
| **40**      | **User VLAN**        | `192.168.40.0/24`   | User Workstations, Faculty, Staff        | PCs, Laptops                    |
| **50**      | **Guest VLAN**       | `192.168.50.0/24`   | Guest Access, Public Internet            | Wireless Access Points (WAPs)   |

### Network Segmentation:
- **Security**: Each VLAN is isolated using **firewall rules** and **ACLs** to restrict unauthorized access between different network segments.
- **Performance**: VLANs reduce broadcast traffic and improve network efficiency by grouping devices based on their functions (e.g., User, Storage, Application).
- **Access Control**: VLANs are enforced with role-based access controls (RBAC), ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive services or storage resources.

### IP Addressing Scheme:
- **Static IPs** are assigned to network devices such as **VM Hosts**, **NAS**, **SAN**, and **switches** for reliable access and management.
- **Dynamic IPs** are assigned to **workstations** and **laptops** using DHCP within the appropriate VLAN subnets.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

To ensure the security of virtualized infrastructure and storage, the following measures are in place:

### 1. **Encryption**:
- **Storage Encryption**: All data stored on SAN and NAS devices is encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.
- **VM Encryption**: Virtual machines are encrypted using built-in encryption features provided by VMware.

### 2. **Access Control**:
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** is implemented to restrict access to virtualized infrastructure and storage based on user roles.
- **Network Segmentation**: Virtualized environments are segmented into secure networks (VLANs) to prevent unauthorized access between different services.

### 3. **Monitoring & Alerts**:
- **Zabbix** is used to monitor the health and performance of virtualized infrastructure, ensuring proactive management of resources.
- **Graylog** is integrated to monitor logs from storage and virtualization systems for any suspicious activities or failures.
