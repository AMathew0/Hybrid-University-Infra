# GCP Hybrid Connectivity, Security Practices, and Measures  
**Hybrid University – Google Cloud Platform Integration**

---

## 📡 1. Hybrid Connectivity Setup (GCP ↔ On-premises / Azure / Microsoft 365)

### 1.1 Purpose

Ensure secure, scalable, and low-latency integration between GCP services (Firebase, BigQuery) and other core systems like Azure AD, Office 365, or on-premises networks.

---

### 1.2 Connectivity Options

| Method                          | Use Case                                               | Notes                             |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Cloud VPN (IPSec)               | Connect on-prem or Azure to GCP VPC                    | Site-to-site encryption            |
| Cloud Interconnect (Partner)    | High-throughput dedicated link (optional)              | Costly, not ideal for EDU          |
| Identity Federation (Azure AD)  | Link Firebase/GCP IAM to Azure AD users (SSO)          | SAML 2.0 support                   |
| Cloud NAT                       | Secure outbound traffic from GCP to internet           | Required for private VMs           |
| Private Google Access           | Access Google APIs privately from on-prem or VMs       | Use with VPC firewall rules        |

---

### 1.3 Sample VPN Setup (Azure ↔ GCP)

1. **Create GCP VPN Gateway**
   - Navigate to: **VPC > VPN > Create VPN**
   - Choose **HA VPN** (recommended)
   - Assign **static IP**, select network and region

2. **Configure Azure VPN Gateway**
   - Use a **policy-based** VPN setup
   - Match pre-shared key, IKE version, IP ranges

3. **Configure Tunnel Settings**
   - Use matching **IPSec policies**
   - Configure **routes** between GCP and Azure subnets

4. **Verify**
   - Use `ping`, `traceroute`, or test app calls
   - Ensure GCP resources can securely reach Azure or on-prem

## 🔒 2. Security Practices for GCP in Hybrid University

### 2.1 Identity & Access Management (IAM)

| Role Name         | Scope                     | Assigned To               |
|-------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| Firebase Admin    | All Firebase services     | App developers             |
| Data Analyst      | BigQuery viewer/editor    | University analytics team  |
| GCP Network Admin | VPN, VPC management       | Infra/network admin        |

- Use **Principle of Least Privilege**
- Enable **2FA/MFA** for all IAM users
- Use **Service Accounts** with scoped permissions for automation

---

### 2.2 Network Security

- Use **VPC firewalls** to allow only necessary ports/IPs  
- Set up **Cloud Armor** for web traffic protection (optional)  
- Implement **Private Google Access** to reduce public exposure  

---

### 2.3 Firebase Security

| Firebase Feature      | Security Measure                                     |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Authentication        | Enable MFA, enforce strong password policies         |
| Firestore Rules       | Use role-based access, timestamp checks              |
| Hosting               | Enforce HTTPS, add custom domain SSL                 |
| FCM                   | Token-based push delivery only                       |
| Realtime Database     | Restrict anonymous access via `database.rules.json`  |

---

### 2.4 Logging & Monitoring

- Enable **Cloud Audit Logs** for IAM, VPC, BigQuery  
- Use **Firebase Analytics** for app behavior monitoring  
- Optionally integrate with **Cloud Monitoring** dashboards  

---

## 🛡️ 3. Data Protection & Compliance

- **Backups**: Use scheduled exports of Firestore to **Cloud Storage**  
- **Data Residency**: Choose region `asia-south1` (Mumbai) or as per compliance  
- **Encryption**:
  - At rest: Enabled by default using Google-managed keys  
  - In transit: TLS 1.2+ used across services  

---

## 🧾 4. Cost Monitoring & Alerts

- Enable **Billing Alerts**: Budget thresholds for Firebase & BigQuery  
- Set **Quotas** on:
  - BigQuery query usage  
  - Firebase Cloud Function invocations  
  - Cloud Storage usage  

---

## ✅ Summary

| Area                | Key Practice                                          |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Hybrid Connectivity | GCP VPN + Azure Site-to-Site                          |
| Identity Management | SAML Federation with Azure AD                         |
| App Security        | Firebase Rules, 2FA, Secure Hosting                   |
| Networking          | VPC, Private Access, NAT, minimal public exposure     |
| Compliance          | India-based data region, default encryption           |
| Monitoring          | Logs, alerts, usage quota monitoring                  |

> Google Cloud acts as an **extension platform** for Hybrid University — not for core identity or LMS hosting. It enables secure, reliable, and cost-efficient mobile applications and analytics.
