# üõ°Ô∏è Application Security Strategy ‚Äì Hybrid University

This document outlines the application security (AppSec) practices implemented at Hybrid University to safeguard web, mobile, and cloud-native applications across development and production environments.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- **Prevent vulnerabilities** such as injection attacks, broken authentication, and misconfigurations.
- Integrate security into the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**.
- Automate security testing within **CI/CD pipelines**.
- Ensure compliance with **OWASP Top 10** and other industry standards.
- Protect applications deployed on **on-premises**, **Azure**, and **GCP** platforms.

---

## üîç OWASP Top 10 Compliance

Hybrid University's AppSec program aligns with the OWASP Top 10, addressing critical security risks in web applications. Key areas of focus include:

- **Injection**: Preventing SQL, NoSQL, and OS command injections.
- **Broken Authentication**: Ensuring secure authentication mechanisms.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Protecting data at rest and in transit.
- **Security Misconfiguration**: Maintaining secure configurations across environments.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Validating and sanitizing user inputs.

For more details, refer to the [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

| Tool/Service        | Purpose                                         |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **OWASP ZAP**       | Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)     |
| **Burp Suite**      | Web vulnerability scanning and penetration testing |
| **Checkmarx**       | Static Application Security Testing (SAST)      |
| **AppSweep**        | Mobile application security testing             |
| **GitLab CI/CD**    | Integrating security checks into development pipelines |
| **Azure DevOps**    | Managing secure code deployments                |
| **GCP Cloud Build** | Automating security scans in GCP environments   |

---

## üîÑ Secure SDLC Integration

Security is embedded throughout the SDLC:

1. **Requirements Phase**: Define security requirements and threat models.
2. **Design Phase**: Conduct architecture risk analysis.
3. **Implementation Phase**: Perform code reviews and static analysis.
4. **Testing Phase**: Execute dynamic testing and vulnerability assessments.
5. **Deployment Phase**: Ensure secure configurations and access controls.
6. **Maintenance Phase**: Monitor applications and respond to incidents.

---

## üß™ Security Testing Practices

- **Static Analysis**: Utilize tools like Checkmarx to identify code-level vulnerabilities.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Employ OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite for runtime testing.
- **Mobile Security**: Use AppSweep for analyzing Android and iOS applications.
- **Dependency Scanning**: Monitor third-party libraries for known vulnerabilities.
- **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular assessments to evaluate security posture.

---

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

- Implement **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for all administrative access.
- Use **OAuth 2.0** and **SAML** protocols for secure user authentication.
- Enforce **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to limit user permissions.
- Regularly review and update access controls and permissions.

---

## üì¶ Secure Deployment Practices

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Manage configurations using tools like Terraform.
- **Container Security**: Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities before deployment.
- **Secrets Management**: Store credentials securely using vault services.
- **Environment Segregation**: Separate development, testing, and production environments.

---

## üìà Monitoring & Incident Response

- **Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging of application activities.
- **Monitoring**: Use tools like Azure Monitor and GCP Stackdriver for real-time insights.
- **Alerting**: Configure alerts for suspicious activities and potential breaches.
- **Incident Response Plan**: Establish procedures for responding to security incidents.

---

## üìä Compliance & Governance

- Adhere to **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** and other relevant regulations.
- Conduct regular **security audits** and **compliance assessments**.
- Maintain documentation of security policies and procedures.
- Provide ongoing **security training** for development and operations teams.
