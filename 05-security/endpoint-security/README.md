## üõ°Ô∏è Antivirus & EDR: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

Hybrid University uses **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** integrated with **Microsoft Intune** to provide comprehensive threat protection and endpoint management across all Windows 10/11 and supported macOS/Linux devices.

### Features:
- Real-time virus/malware protection.
- Automated investigation and remediation (AIR).
- Endpoint detection & response (EDR) analytics and behavior monitoring.
- Integration with Microsoft 365 security ecosystem.
- Managed via **Intune Endpoint Security Policies**.

### Deployment:
- Enforced through **Microsoft Intune** for all university-managed Windows devices.
- Custom security baselines and alerts configured for high-risk activities.

---

## üîí Drive Encryption

To ensure data-at-rest protection, full disk encryption is enforced on all university-owned devices.

| **OS**       | **Encryption Tool** | **Enforcement**                        |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Windows 10/11| BitLocker           | Enabled via Intune MDM policy          |
| Linux        | LUKS                | Manually encrypted during provisioning |

- **BitLocker recovery keys** are securely stored in Azure AD and/or backed up to a secure admin vault.
- Regular checks ensure encryption compliance.

---

## üåê Web Protection: FortiGuard DNS Filtering

All user and staff devices are protected by **FortiGuard DNS filtering**, enforcing safe browsing policies and blocking access to malicious or inappropriate websites.

### Highlights:
- Cloud-managed DNS filter policies.
- Blocks malware/phishing domains, proxies, adult content, etc.
- Integrated with firewall and endpoint policies.
- Compatible with on-campus and remote access scenarios.

---

## üìß Email Security & DLP

Microsoft 365-based services are protected by integrated security solutions:

### Microsoft Purview (Data Loss Prevention):
- Enforces policies to restrict sharing of sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers, student IDs).
- Alerts admins when sensitive data is shared externally or unapproved.

### Microsoft Defender for Office 365:
- Phishing & malware protection for Exchange Online.
- Safe Links and Safe Attachments scanning.
- Real-time email threat intelligence and quarantine.

---

## üåç SSL & DNS Security

To ensure secure access to online services and public-facing portals, Hybrid University uses:

| **Service**          | **Tool/Provider**         | **Function**                        |
|----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| SSL Certificate Mgmt | Let‚Äôs Encrypt              | Auto-renewing TLS certificates      |
| DNS / CDN / DDoS     | Cloudflare                | Secure DNS, CDN, DDoS mitigation    |

### Implementation:
- All public web apps are protected with **Cloudflare Pro features** (WAF, DNSSEC, Bot Management).
- All hosted sites use **HTTPS** with free certificates via **Let‚Äôs Encrypt**, automatically renewed.
- **DNS** managed via Cloudflare ensures fast resolution, security (DNSSEC), and geo-performance.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices Enforced

- Devices must be compliant with encryption and antivirus policies to access corporate resources.
- Alerts and analytics from Defender and Fortinet feed into centralized monitoring (e.g., Microsoft Sentinel, Graylog).
- Devices connecting from outside must pass compliance checks via **Conditional Access Policies**.
- Guest and BYOD devices are isolated using VLANs and do not have access to internal resources.

---

## üìå Future Enhancements

- Integration with **SIEM (Graylog / Sentinel)** for unified alerting.
- Endpoint patch automation using **Intune + Winget + PowerShell scripts**.
- BYOD containerization via **Microsoft Endpoint Manager** or **Mobile Application Management (MAM)**.
