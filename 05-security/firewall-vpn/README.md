# üî• Firewall & VPN Security Strategy ‚Äì Hybrid University

This document outlines the design and management of firewall and VPN solutions deployed across Hybrid University to safeguard on-campus and remote access infrastructure.

---

## üåê Objectives

- Enforce **network perimeter protection** using enterprise-grade firewalls.
- Secure **remote staff and faculty access** via VPN.
- Implement **segmented and isolated VLANs** for different departments and services.
- Ensure **deep packet inspection (DPI)** and intrusion prevention.

## üõ°Ô∏è Firewall Components

| Device         | Role                        | Deployment Zone     | Features Used                          |
|----------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| FortiGate 200D | Main perimeter firewall      | Central HQ          | IPS, DPI, Web Filtering, VLAN Routing  |
| FortiGate 100D | Branch/Secondary firewall    | Remote Campus        | VPN, NAT, Policy-Based Routing         |
| Cloudflare     | Web application firewall     | Public Web Services | DDoS Protection, DNS Proxy, TLS Certs  |

## üß± VLAN & Network Segmentation Design

To isolate traffic and enforce least privilege access, the network is divided into functional VLANs.

| VLAN ID | Department/Zone       | Subnet              | Description                          |
|---------|------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 10      | Management/Admin       | 10.0.10.0/24         | IT admins, core infrastructure       |
| 20      | Academic Staff         | 10.0.20.0/24         | Faculty and teaching staff           |
| 30      | Student Network        | 10.0.30.0/24         | Internet-limited network             |
| 40      | Servers                | 10.0.40.0/24         | Data, DNS, Zabbix, GitHub runners    |
| 50      | Wi-Fi Devices          | 10.0.50.0/24         | Mobile & BYOD devices                |
| 99      | Guest Wi-Fi            | 10.0.99.0/24         | Internet-only guest access           |

## üîê VPN Access ‚Äì Faculty & Remote Admins

### üîß VPN Technologies Used

| VPN Type      | Technology     | Use Case                       |
|---------------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| Site-to-Site  | IPsec (FortiGate) | Secure campus interconnect     |
| Remote Access | SSL VPN        | Staff & Admin remote access    |

### üõ†Ô∏è VPN Policy Configuration (FortiGate)

- **Authentication**: Azure AD (via SAML) or local LDAP
- **Split Tunneling**: Disabled (all traffic routed via VPN)
- **User Groups**: `Admins`, `Faculty-VPN`, `IT-VPN`
- **Access Control**: VLAN-restricted per group

---

## üîÑ High Availability (HA)

- Primary/Secondary FortiGate pairs configured in **Active-Passive HA mode**
- **Automatic failover** enabled for seamless transition
- Monitored via **SNMP + Zabbix alerts**

---

## üîç Logging & Monitoring

- **FortiAnalyzer** or syslog forwarding to **Graylog**
- Firewall logs retained for 180 days
- VPN login logs integrated with **Microsoft Sentinel** for anomaly detection

---

## üìú Backup & Configuration Management

- Daily auto-backups of firewall configurations to a secured internal share
- Monthly configuration audits stored in Git versioned repo (private)

---

## üìå Best Practices

- Enforce **Geo-IP blocking** for unnecessary regions
- Regular **rule cleanup and audit** (quarterly)
- Use **Application Control** for web-based traffic shaping
- Enable **certificate inspection** for encrypted traffic analysis
- VLAN access controlled by **FortiGate inter-VLAN policies**
