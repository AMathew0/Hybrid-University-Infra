# üîÅ **Backup & Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan**

This step outlines a **multi-layered backup and disaster recovery strategy** for the hybrid university infrastructure. The objective is to ensure business continuity, data protection, and rapid recovery in the event of data loss, ransomware, site failure, or human error.

## üîÑ Sample Backup Flow: Moodle LMS (Self-hosted)

```text
1. pg_dump exports the database nightly to `/backups/lms-db/`
2. Rsync syncs Moodle content directory to `/backups/lms-files/`
3. rclone syncs both folders to AWS S3 (versioned)
4. Veeam backs up EC2 VM image to NAS
5. If VM crashes, restore from Proxmox backup, then re-import DB
```

---

## üß™ Example DR Drill (Quarterly)

```text
Scenario: New Delhi Datacenter Power Failure
1. Notify IT team via monitoring alert (Zabbix)
2. Spin up standby Proxmox host in Bangalore
3. Restore VM images from local NAS (or AWS S3)
4. Validate AD, Moodle, and SIS access
5. Failback to Delhi after issue resolved
```

---

## üß∞ Suggested Enhancements

* üîê **Enable at-rest and in-transit encryption** (AES-256 + SSL)
* üîÅ **Automate backup scripts using systemd timers or Task Scheduler**
* üîÅ **Version all backups in cloud (for ransomware rollback)**
* ‚úÖ **Monthly restore testing from each storage level (NAS, S3, Glacier)**
* üîç **Use monitoring (Zabbix) to alert on failed backups**

## üîê Compliance & Audit

| Type             | Strategy                                             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Audit Logs       | Store logs of each backup run + file integrity check |
| Immutable Backup | Use S3 Object Lock / Glacier Vault Lock              |
| GDPR/FERPA       | Encrypt personal data; store in EU/India             |
