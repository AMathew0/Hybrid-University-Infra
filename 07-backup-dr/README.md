# üíæ Backup & Disaster Recovery Strategy ‚Äì Hybrid University

This document outlines the Backup and Disaster Recovery (DR) framework implemented at Hybrid University to ensure data integrity, business continuity, and compliance with institutional IT governance.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Ensure **data availability** during failures or disasters.
- Enable **rapid recovery** with clearly defined RTO and RPO.
- Support **hybrid infrastructure** with both on-premises and cloud workloads.
- Automate and secure backup operations across environments.

## üß∞ Backup Components Overview

| Component           | Stack                                               | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| VM/Server Backup    | Veeam Community Edition                             | Protects up to 10 VMs/workloads; snapshot-based VM backup                   |
| File-Level Backup   | Rsync + Rclone                                      | Local sync with Rsync; Cloud sync to AWS S3 via Rclone                      |
| Cloud-Native Backup | AWS Backup, Azure Backup                            | Backup EC2, RDS, S3 (AWS); M365 mailboxes, SharePoint (Azure)              |
| DR Site             | Proxmox (cold standby), AWS S3 offsite replication  | Proxmox standby node for recovery; critical data replicated to S3          |

## üïí Recovery Objectives

| Metric | Value                                |
|--------|--------------------------------------|
| **RTO** | 4 hours (for critical systems)       |
| **RPO** | 1 hour (for critical data sets)      |

---

## üñ•Ô∏è VM & Server Backup ‚Äì Veeam

- **Tool**: [Veeam Backup & Replication Community Edition](https://www.veeam.com/virtual-machine-backup-solution-free.html)
- **Scope**: Up to 10 workloads (Proxmox, ESXi, Hyper-V, physical servers)
- **Frequency**: Daily incremental with weekly full
- **Storage**: Local NAS + offsite AWS S3 sync
- **Retention**: 30 days for full backups, 90 days for archives

---

## üìÅ File-Level Backup ‚Äì Rsync + Rclone

### Rsync:

- Used for incremental backups of critical directories (e.g., `/etc`, `/home`, `/var/lib`)
- Scheduled using `cron` for hourly or daily syncs

### Rclone:

- Syncs Rsync backups to **AWS S3 (Glacier or Standard)** for offsite redundancy
- Can also sync to **Backblaze B2**, **Azure Blob**, or **Google Cloud Storage**

```bash
# Example cron job
0 * * * * rsync -avz /home/ /mnt/backup/home/
0 2 * * * rclone sync /mnt/backup s3:hybrid-university-backups --progress

```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud-Native Backups

AWS:
AWS Backup used for:

EC2 snapshots
RDS daily backups
S3 lifecycle rules for archiving

Azure:
Azure Backup for:
Microsoft 365: Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive
Endpoint data (via Microsoft Defender integration)

## üßØ Disaster Recovery Site ‚Äì Cold Standby Node

Hardware: Secondary Proxmox node stored at a separate campus
Mode: Cold standby (powered down except for tests/monthly sync)
Backup Restoration: Veeam image restores or ISO-based deployment
Data Sync: Replicated via Rclone to offsite S3 bucket

## üìä Monitoring & Reporting

Backup Logs: Collected from Veeam, Rsync, Rclone via syslog or Graylog
Health Reports: Weekly reports sent via email from Veeam and GLPI
Failure Alerts: Integrated with Zabbix for real-time alerting on backup failures

## üîê Security Measures

All backup data is encrypted using AES-256 before storage.
Rclone and AWS S3 use server-side encryption (SSE-S3/SSE-KMS).
Access to backup repositories is restricted via IAM roles and multi-factor authentication.

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

Layer	Toolset Used	Backup Frequency	Retention	Offsite Sync
VM/Server	Veeam Community Edition	Daily/Weekly	30/90 Days	Yes (AWS S3 via Rclone)
File-Level	Rsync + Rclone	Hourly/Daily	7/30 Days	Yes
Cloud	AWS Backup / Azure Backup	Daily	As per policy	Built-in
DR Site	Cold Proxmox Node + S3 Replica	Weekly Snapshots	Manual Restore	Yes

## üìå Conclusion
Hybrid University's Backup & Disaster Recovery strategy combines robust open-source tools with cloud-native services to ensure high availability, rapid recovery, and data integrity. With a defined RTO/RPO framework, the institution is prepared for operational disruptions while remaining cost-effective and compliant.
