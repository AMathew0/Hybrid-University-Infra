## üñ•Ô∏è Zabbix 6.4 LTS ‚Äì Core Monitoring

### Key Features

- Monitors: Servers (Linux/Windows), switches, firewalls, printers
- Agent-based and SNMP-based integrations
- Low-level discovery for disks, network interfaces, services
- Alerting via email and future Telegram webhook integration

### Deployment Notes

- Installed on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS VM
- Integrated with MySQL + NGINX
- Custom templates for FortiGate, Cisco, Proxmox

---

## üìä Grafana + Prometheus ‚Äì Dashboards

### Setup

- Grafana pulls metrics from Prometheus (for Linux nodes)
- Additional datasource: Zabbix plugin for Grafana

### Use Cases

- Visualize CPU, memory, disk, bandwidth, uptime
- Executive dashboard for Uptime SLAs and server health
- Alert thresholds configured using Prometheus alert rules

---

## üìÑ Graylog 5 ‚Äì Centralized Log Management

### Features

- Collects logs from:
  - Linux servers (`rsyslog`)
  - Windows servers via NXLog
  - Firewalls (FortiGate, Cisco), proxy logs
- Supports GELF, syslog, JSON formats
- Searchable archives for compliance and investigations

### Deployment

- Runs on separate Ubuntu VM
- MongoDB + OpenSearch backend
- Role-based access controls (RBAC) for auditors/admins

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS CloudWatch

### Use Cases

- EC2 metrics: CPU, disk, memory (via CloudWatch Agent)
- RDS performance metrics and backup status
- CloudWatch Alarms for EC2 instance states and usage spikes
- AWS Backup job status and health alerts

## üîî Alerting Strategy

| Source       | Tool Used      | Notification Channel     |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Zabbix       | Internal alert system | Email, Telegram Webhook (planned) |
| Prometheus   | Alertmanager (future) | Email, Slack (planned)           |
| Graylog      | Stream alerts        | Email, Syslog forwarders         |
| CloudWatch   | CloudWatch Alarms    | AWS SNS ‚Üí Email                   |

---

## üîê Security & Compliance

- Logs are encrypted at rest (Graylog/OpenSearch)
- Access to monitoring platforms restricted via LDAP/SSO (where supported)
- Audit logs retained for 1 year, archived to AWS Glacier
